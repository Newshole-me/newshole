<b>The Gist</b>

The Shepherd Chamber of Commerce will be hosting a Scarecrow Contest in October. The scarecrow will be life-sized and should be decorated to show Bluejay pride. Submitted scarecrows will be tied to the streetlights along Wright Avenue.

Scarecrow entries should be submitted to Gina Gross at the Village Office by 5 p.m. on Thursday, October 3. Scarecrows will be on display outside between October 3 and November 1. Judging will take place on the evening of the October 3.
